# Introduction to Neuro/AI Crash Course

Hello! Welcome to the Introduction to Neuro/AI Interactive Intelligence (i2) crash course (now opencourseware)! If you are reading this, you are most likely a member of our team or another Neuro/AI adjacent club. If not, be sure to join one!

We hope you are excited to learn more about machine learning and its intersection with neuroscience. To get started, check out the `schedule.md` file. **This is where you will have guided content week-to-week**

Please remember:
- We are all trying to learn, and learn at different speeds.
- This course is somewhat of a commitment. You will get out what you put in
